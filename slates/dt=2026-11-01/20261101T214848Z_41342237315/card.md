**Research execution (RESEARCH GOVERNANCE, not model truth):** research bankroll $250, whole-dollar stakes, max $5 per wager; ≤ 1 funded player prop per game; ≤ 2 funded player props with adjusted p < 0.30 per slate; player props 10+ pts from the Kalshi mid need corroboration. SHADOW_ONLY = $0 (logged for learning). Nothing is placed.

## Slate portfolios (simulated P/L on the joint draws)

EV / median / P(profit) / percentiles use the MODEL's joint distribution at executable costs; 'EV adj' and 'adj growth' use the confidence-adjusted probabilities (the optimiser's objective). A uses raw model probabilities and independent stakes, so its model EV can look larger.
